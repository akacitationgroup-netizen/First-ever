# Small static site (copy-paste starter)

Files added/updated:

- `index.html` — main HTML file (header, hero, features, about, contact form)
- `assets/css/main.css` — site styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — small interactions (mobile nav + form validation)

How to use

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open `index.html` and click the Live Preview extension or open the file in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open With → Browser).

Notes

- This is a static demo. The contact form uses client-side validation and simulates sending — it does not actually send emails.
- Replace the sample image at `images/pic02.jpg` or update the `img` src in `index.html`.
- Edit `assets/css/main.css` to customize colors and spacing.

If you want, I can:

- Add a simple `package.json` and a tiny dev server script
- Hook the form up to a real endpoint (Netlify Forms, Formspree, or your server)
